# Install


# How To Use It

# Dev & Contribution

To test or contribute to this project:

#### Step 1. Clone this project:

```
git clone https://github.com/nicolasdao/fairplay-sdk.git
```

#### Step 2. Install all depedencies:

```
npm i
```

#### Step 3. Build the SDK locally

```
npm run build
```

This uses Babel+Webpack to convert the ES6 code to a minified JS `index.min.js`. This minified file is added under a new `dist` folder.  

#### Step 4. Test it is working

```
npm start
```

This starts a server on port 3000. The dummy HTML page uses the `dist/index.min.js` file built in step 3.
